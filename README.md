# Basic Arithmetic Operations

This Python program performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using functions.

Use merging to combine branches so that the main.py code in the main branch appears as follows: 

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    return x / y

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = 10
    b = 5

    print("Addition:", add(a, b))
    print("Subtraction:", subtract(a, b))
    print("Multiplication:", multiply(a, b))
    print("Division:", divide(a, b))
